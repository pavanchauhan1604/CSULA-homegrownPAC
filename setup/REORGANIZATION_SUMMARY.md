**Date:** October 27, 2025

The CSULA PDF Accessibility Checker project has been reorganized for better clarity and ease of use.

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. **New Folder Structure**

#### `scripts/` folder (NEW)
All executable scripts moved here:
- ✅ `run_workflow.sh` - Complete workflow automation
- ✅ `fresh_start.sh` - Clean and reset everything
- ✅ `check_progress.sh` - Monitor running processes
- ✅ `setup_test_environment.py` - Database and CSV setup

#### `setup/` folder (NEW)
All documentation consolidated here:
- 📘 `COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - **Main guide** (replaces 7 previous guides)
- 📋 `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick commands and troubleshooting
- 📦 `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Step-by-step installation
- 📁 `archive/` - Old documentation files (preserved)

### 2. **Simplified Documentation**

**BEFORE:** 7 separate documentation files
- QUICKSTART.md
- QUICKSTART_RUN.md
- CONFIG_SETUP.md
- CONFIGURATION_COMPLETE.md
- CONFIG_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
- RUN_WORKFLOW.md
- README.md

**AFTER:** 3 clear guides
- ✅ **COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Everything in one place
- ✅ **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Commands and troubleshooting
- ✅ **INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md** - Software installation steps

### 3. **Updated README.md**

New README is clean and points to the comprehensive guides:
- Quick start command
- Links to setup guides
- Project overview
- Common commands

## 🚀 How to Use the New Structure

### Quick Start (Same as Before!)
```bash
cd /Users/pavan/Work/CSULA-homegrownPAC
./scripts/fresh_start.sh && ./scripts/run_workflow.sh
```

### Read Documentation
1. **First time?** → Read `setup/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`
2. **Need full details?** → Read `setup/COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. **Quick lookup?** → Use `setup/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

### Run Scripts
```bash
# All scripts are now in scripts/ folder
./scripts/run_workflow.sh
./scripts/fresh_start.sh
./scripts/check_progress.sh
```

---

## ✅ Benefits of Reorganization

### Before
- ❌ Scripts scattered in root directory
- ❌ 7 overlapping documentation files
- ❌ Unclear which guide to read first
- ❌ Redundant information across files

### After
- ✅ All scripts in dedicated `scripts/` folder
- ✅ Single comprehensive guide (3 total docs)
- ✅ Clear entry point (README → guides)
- ✅ No redundancy - each guide has specific purpose
- ✅ Easy to navigate and understand

---

## 📝 What Was Preserved

**No functionality was changed!**

All the following remain exactly the same:
- ✅ `config.py` configuration
- ✅ Core code in `src/`
- ✅ Database structure
- ✅ CSV file formats
- ✅ Crawlers and spiders
- ✅ Report generation
- ✅ Workflow steps
- ✅ SQL queries

**Only changed:**
- Location of shell scripts (moved to `scripts/`)
- Documentation organization (consolidated in `setup/`)
- Updated script paths in `run_workflow.sh`

---

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### If You Have Existing Bookmarks/Aliases

**Update these paths:**

```bash
# OLD paths
./run_workflow.sh
./fresh_start.sh
./check_progress.sh
python3 setup_test_environment.py

# NEW paths
./scripts/run_workflow.sh
./scripts/fresh_start.sh
./scripts/check_progress.sh
python3 scripts/setup_test_environment.py
```

### If You Have Cron Jobs

Update cron entries:
```bash
# OLD
0 2 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && ./run_workflow.sh

# NEW
0 2 * * 1 cd /path/to/project && ./scripts/run_workflow.sh
```

## 📚 Documentation Index

| Document | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Project overview & quick start | First look at project |
| `setup/INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` | Software installation | Setting up on new machine |
| `setup/COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` | Complete usage guide | Full reference |
| `setup/QUICK_REFERENCE.md` | Commands & troubleshooting | Quick lookup |
| `setup/archive/` | Old documentation | Historical reference |

---

## ✅ Verification

To verify the reorganization worked:

```bash
# Check scripts exist
ls -la scripts/

# Check documentation exists
ls -la setup/

# Test a script
./scripts/check_progress.sh

# View new README
cat README.md

# Verify old docs are archived
ls setup/archive/
```

---

- **Better organized** - Clear folder structure
- **Easier to use** - Single comprehensive guide
- **More maintainable** - No redundant documentation
- **Fully functional** - All features work exactly as before
