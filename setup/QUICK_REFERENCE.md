## 📊 Database Queries

```sql
-- Count total PDFs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM drupal_pdf_files;

-- Count unique PDFs
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT pdf_uri) FROM drupal_pdf_files;

-- Count analyzed PDFs
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pdf_report;

-- PDFs with most violations
SELECT pdf_hash, violations 
FROM pdf_report 
ORDER BY violations DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Domain statistics
SELECT 
    s.domain_name, 
    COUNT(p.id) as pdf_count 
FROM drupal_site s 
LEFT JOIN drupal_pdf_files p ON s.id = p.drupal_site_id 
GROUP BY s.domain_name;
```
