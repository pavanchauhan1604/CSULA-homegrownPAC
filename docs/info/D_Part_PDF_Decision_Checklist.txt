D-PAR PDF Decision Checklists
Digital accessibility is a legal and ethical obligation that ensures everyone—including people with disabilities—can access, understand, and use digital content equitably. Under the ADA (Titles I & II) and the Rehabilitation Act (Sections 504 & 508), public institutions must make both public-facing and employee-facing content accessible. This includes websites, documents, forms, training materials, and internal portals.

The tables below provide clear checklists to help teams determine when PDFs must be accessible, when they may be left alone, and when they should be removed or replaced. They also outline the technical features required for a PDF to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, and offer specific guidance for internal documents hosted behind login systems or on intranets. 

D-PAR PDF Remediation Guidelines
Can I Archive this PDF?
The 2024 ADA Title II Final Rule allows certain PDFs to be exempt from accessibility remediation if they qualify as archived content. However, this exemption only applies to Title II public-facing content, not to internal content covered under Title I. 
 

ADA Title I vs. Title II – Archive Rule Applicability
ADA Title	Covers	Archive Rule Applies?	Examples
Title II	Public-facing content and services provided by state and local government (e.g., university websites, admissions info, academic program pages)	Yes — if all archive conditions are met	PDFs on department websites, archived event flyers, old academic catalogs
Title I	Employment-related information, internal systems, and documents used by employees (e.g., HR onboarding, internal training, staff portals)	No — archived PDFs must still be accessible to employees with disabilities	HR forms, benefits guides, job instructions behind SSO or on intranet
Archived content must still be provided in an accessible format upon request.

A PDF can be archived if all four conditions are met.
It was created before the April 24, 2026 compliance deadline
It is kept only for reference, research, or record-keeping
It has not been modified or updated since being archived
It is clearly marked as archived, either by:
Being stored in an “Archive” section
Having “Archive” or “Archived” in the file name or page title (e.g., 2017-Flyer-Archived.pdf)
Moved into an dedicated archive box.com folder and labeld publically as archived.
What to do with archived PDFs 
Please follow the detailed archive guidline to move archivable PDFs into box.

Eligibility: Content can be archived if it meets all 4 criteria: created before ADA compliance date, kept only for reference/research/recordkeeping, stored in a designated archive area, and unchanged since archiving
Step 1 - Move to Box: Create an "Archived [Content Name]" folder in Box, upload files there, and rename each file to include "Archived" in the filename
Step 2 - Update Drupal: Add a new section at the bottom of your page (or in a second column) with:
H2 heading titled "Archived [Content Name]"
Required disclaimer text about accessibility standards and ADA Title II exemption
Bulleted list of archived files with Box shared links
Step 3 - Create A Single Box Link: Put that link into the archived section. All traffic to your archived files should flow through that single link.
Step 4 - Cleanup: Delete the original files from Drupal after successfully moving them to Box to avoid confusion
Key Note: Archives should be placed at the bottom of pages to lower content hierarchy, with clear labeling and the mandatory accessibility disclaimer
You do not need to remediate them, as long as they remain inactive and clearly labeled and stored in an "archive" section of your page.
You must still provide an accessible version upon request to meet effective communication standards.
Archived files should not appear in current navigation, homepage links, or service pages.
Use the following disclaimer in Archive sections:

“Archived Content: This content is no longer maintained and may not meet current accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA). It has been archived in accordance with the Archived Web Content exception defined in ADA Title II, 28 C.F.R. § 35.104. To request an accessible version or an equally effective alternative format, please email access@sfsu.edu".

please send an email access@sfsu.edu to schedule a consultation.

Inclusion/Exclusion Checklist – Does the PDF Need Remediation?
This checklist helps determine whether a PDF hosted on a public-facing SF State website must be remediated to meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards under ADA Title II or Section 508. It guides content owners in identifying which PDFs must be made accessible, which may be left as-is, and which can be removed based on their usage, date of publication, and relevance.

ADA Title II: Public Facing PDFs
ADA Title II: Determine If a PDF Requires Remediation on a Public Site
Condition or Situation	Recommended Action
PDF was posted or updated after your ADA/WCAG compliance date (April 2026)	Remediate
PDF is actively used for critical services, forms, or public processes	Remediate
PDF is frequently accessed or downloaded	Remediate
PDF contains legally required or program-critical information	Remediate
PDF is historical, pre-dates the rule, and is archived (not updated or used)	Left Alone (unless requested)
PDF is outdated, rarely accessed, and no longer needed	Remove
PDF content duplicates an accessible webpage	Remove or Left Alone if clearly marked archival
PDF is mostly visual and cannot be remediated practically	Remove or replace with accessible alternative
PDF is an image-only scan and lacks a searchable text layer	Remove or replace with accessible version
ADA Title I Accessibility Checklist for PDFs Behind SSO or Intranets
This table provides guidance on whether internal documents (e.g., behind a login or on intranet) must be made accessible under ADA Title I. While not public-facing, these materials are essential for employees to perform job duties or access workplace benefits, and therefore must be accessible to ensure equal employment opportunity. SF State websites sharing information regarding internal operations will be moved behind SSO in 2026. This is a good time to decide which PDFs need to be accessible.

ADA Title I: Accessibility Requirements for PDFs on Internal Networks or Behind SSO
Condition or Situation	Accessibility Required?	Recommended Action
PDF used for essential employee tasks (training, job functions, procedures)	Yes	Remediate
Internal policy documents (employee handbooks, HR guidelines, safety instructions)	Yes	Remediate
PDF containing benefits information, payroll, or legally required employment notifications	Yes	Remediate
Internal forms necessary for employment-related processes (e.g., leave requests, accommodation requests)	Yes	Remediate
Archived internal documents (historical reference, no active use, clearly labeled as archival)	No, unless requested	Left Alone (Provide accommodation if requested)
PDF posted for internal use after ADA compliance policy implementation	Yes	Remediate
PDF contains duplicate content available through an already accessible internal HTML or text-based document	No	Remove or mark clearly as archival/redundant
Internal-use PDF is rarely or never accessed, outdated, and irrelevant to current procedures or practices	No	Remove or archive offline
Complex PDF (image-based scans, complex graphics) critical for employee use but challenging to remediate	Yes	Replace with accessible alternative or HTML-based equivalent
Employee-generated PDFs uploaded for personal use, not broadly shared or required by others	No	Left Alone (unless requested for accessibility)
WCAG 2.1 AA PDF Accessibility Technical Checklist
Once a PDF is identified as needing remediation, this technical checklist outlines the specific accessibility features it must include to conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Each row describes a required feature—such as semantic tagging, alt text, and language declaration—and provides practical action steps for compliance. This is especially helpful for content creators, editors, and accessibility teams preparing or auditing public-facing documents.

Step 2: WCAG 2.1 AA Accessibility Features for PDFs
Checkpoint	Criteria Description	Action Required
Tagged PDF	Proper semantic tags for headings, lists, tables	Apply tags using Acrobat or remediation software
Text Readability	Text must be selectable, with logical reading order	Review reading order in Acrobat's Order pane
Image Alt Text	All meaningful images must have descriptions	Use Acrobat to add alt text to images/figures
Tables	Header cells tagged with correct scope and structure	Tag and verify table headers, use table editor
Form Fields	All form inputs labeled and keyboard-accessible	Add tooltips/labels and test keyboard operability
Links	Descriptive link text, not "click here"	Edit links for clarity and context
Color Contrast	Text must meet 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum	Test using Acrobat or WebAIM contrast checker
Document Title	PDF must have a descriptive title in metadata	Set in File > Properties > Title
Bookmarks	Bookmarks for navigation in longer PDFs	Add via Acrobat's Bookmarks panel
Language Declaration	Document language must be specified	Set language in Document Properties > Advanced
No Text as Images	Text must not be rendered as images only	Use OCR tools to convert image-only text into real text
